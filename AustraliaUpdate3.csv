protect NRM and cultural values’. The final report for this project (Edwards, Zeng, Saalfeld et al. 2008)
provides a much higher level of detail in relation to the work undertaken for the project, including
additional recommendations pertaining to individual research components.
Feral camels are well adapted to the conditions found in desert Australia and have now occupied
3.3 million km2. Feral camels are one of the 73 or so species of introduced vertebrates occurring on
mainland Australia that do not meet the criteria to justify eradication effort. For such species, the
management options are containment, control, or no management (Australian Pest Animal Strategy
2007).
Because they occur in sparsely populated areas, feral camels are only noticed when their activities
intersect with remote Aboriginal people, pastoralists, and the tourism and mining industries. The
significant damage that camels have done, and are currently doing, to the fragile ecosystems, cultural
sites, isolated communities, and pastoral enterprises of desert Australia has gone largely unnoticed by
the bulk of Australia’s population. The current estimated population of about one million feral camels is
doubling approximately every nine years (Saalfeld & Edwards 2008) and there is evidence that impacts
will increase along with the population (Edwards, Zeng, and Saalfeld 2008). If we do not act now to
mitigate the damage being caused by feral camels, irreparable damage may be done, particularly to
environmental and cultural values, across much of desert Australia. The longer we take to act, the more
it will cost to manage and repair the negative impacts of feral camels.
Management of the impacts of pest animals should be informed by a risk management approach and be
strategic in determining where management should occur, at what time, and what techniques should be
used (Australian Pest Animal Strategy 2007). It requires coordination at the appropriate scale among all
levels of government in partnership with industry, land managers, and the community (Australian Pest
Animal Strategy 2007). The current management of feral camels, being largely ad hoc (Edwards et al.
2004), fails to adequately meet any of these criteria.
If we are to develop a strategic, coordinated risk management approach to mitigating the impacts of
feral camels, it must be done at the national scale because:
There is a large population of camels occurring over a large area which includes parts of Western
Australia (WA), South Australia (SA), Queensland (Qld), and the Northern Territory (NT) (Saalfeld
& Edwards 2008).
Camels are very mobile animals that can move over large distances in relatively short time periods
(Saalfeld & Edwards 2008).
Many camels occur in very remote areas that are sparsely populated by people (Saalfeld & Edwards
2008, Saalfeld et al. 2008).
There are differing perceptions on feral camels and their impacts (Zeng & Edwards 2008a, 2008b;
Vaarzon-Morel 2008a).
Camels are considered both a pest and a resource (Edwards, Zeng, and Saalfeld 2008), which can
lead to conflicting goals between the various stakeholders in respect of their management.
The research described in this report was funded by the Australian Government. It was conducted with
the overarching aim of developing a national management framework which will lead to a reduction
in camel numbers to a level that reverses their current population growth trajectory and reduces their
impacts on natural resource management (NRM), economic, and social-cultural values.",,,,2007,2008,Public and social welfare,Management_costs,,

animals for food, water and shelter; damage to sites such as waterholes, that have cultural significance to Aboriginal
people; destruction of bushfood resources; reduction in Aboriginal people’s enjoyment of natural areas; creation of
dangerous driving conditions; damage to people and vehicles due to collisions, and being a general nuisance in remote

livestock production through camels competing with stock for food and other resources and damage to production-related
infrastructure. The annual net impact cost of feral camels was estimated to be –$10.67 million for those elements that
could be evaluated according to market values. We established a positive density/damage relationship for camels and
infrastructure on pastoral properties, which is likely to hold true for environmental variables and cultural/social variables
as well. Therefore, irrespective of climate change, the magnitude of the negative impacts of feral camels will undoubtedly
increase if the population is allowed to continue to increase. Furthermore, the likelihood that camels would be
epidemiologically involved in the spread of exotic diseases like bluetongue and surra (were there to be outbreaks of these
diseases in Australia) is also very likely to increase with population density. On the basis of our present understanding, we
recommend that feral camels be managed to a long-term target density of 0.1–0.2 camels/km2 at property to regional

understanding about the distribution and abundance of feral camels, perspective on camel impacts, and attitudes towards
different camel management options. Camels occurred on 74.2% of pastoral properties and 51.4% of reserves that were
surveyed. Camels were reported to be increasing on more than 50% of pastoral properties and 88% of reserves and were
reported to cause damage on most properties where they occurred. The total monetary value of this damage (including

TFGA members are responsible for generating approximately 80% of the value created by the Tasmanian agricultural sector.
Agriculture is one of the key pillars of the economy and, with the current level of support from government, are well positioned to further capitalise on the stature of Tasmania agriculture.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that Tasmania’s Gross State Product for 2014-15 was $25.42 billion. Agriculture, forestry and fishing in 2014-15 was Tasmania’s largest industry representing 9.6% ($2.29B) of Tasmania’s total gross value added. 1
TFGA understand that many farmers consider feral fallow deer hunting to be part of their normal farming income streams and they manage their properties and farming businesses accordingly. However, not all farmers are of this view and those who do not wish to be involved in hunting activities should not be expected to manage, feed and house feral fallow deer populations that are negatively impacting on their income and potentially increasing the risk of transfer of disease and pests.
Deer are not managed like other feral animals, such as rabbits, which are subject to the Vermin Control Act and therefore the full range of pest management controls. Fallow deer control is subject to a licensing (permit) system for seasonal harvesting of males and does, tagging, reporting of number harvested and, differentiating between recreational and crop protection management programs.
Through a recent survey undertaken by TFGA the results showed that a large percentage of those surveyed want a state policy control framework for control of feral fallow deer that should be more flexible and include the capacity for farmers to cull deer throughout the whole year.
The TFGA is of the view that any variation to control and reduction should be undertaken in conjunction with a risk assessment of feral fallow deer. This would essentially mean increased investigation and provide clarity in quantitative and qualitative terms of the negative economic, environmental and social impacts of feral fallow deer population. It would provide an informed foundation for the regulatory impact statement underpinning legislative changes such as “eradication” in legislative regulations enabling fallow deer regulation. A risk assessment would fully address the scope and evaluate the benefits to farmers and private land tenants of economic, social and environmental costs and resources required to undertake ‘eradication’.",,,,2016,2016,Mixed,Damage-Loss,,

agricultural industries and the environment, are estimated in this desk-top review. This provides a ‘triple
bottom line’ national perspective on vertebrate pest animal impact. Pests were selected on the basis of
relevance to current and potential Pest Animal Control CRC research activities, and in consultation with
centre staff. Annual cost values include control and production loss estimates. Many gaps exist in our
knowledge of the major environmental and social impacts vertebrate pests have, therefore these impacts
are discussed for each pest in qualitative terms. However, where quantitative impact information is readily
available it is also included. Major control costs included in the economic impact assessment included baiting, fencing, shooting, and
research associated with the improved management of the specific species. Production losses were
estimated for sheep, cattle and cropping industries as a result of predation on young stock, crop damage
and competition for feed. In addition to these agricultural losses, public sector research and management
costs were included in the economic cost section.
Environmental impacts were typically based on the vertebrate pest’s impact on biodiversity. Where possible,
these impacts have been quantified in cost terms, although it should be noted that accurate information
relating to ecological cause and effect relationships, along with the communities’ valuation of species
preservation are not readily available. Environmental valuations were undertaken for feral cat, fox and carp
impacts, as data was in evidence for these species.
The cost impact of the 11 species subject to assessment totalled $720 million per year. Feral pigs, rabbits,
foxes and feral cats were estimated to account for 83% of losses and agricultural productivity loss accounts
for about half of total costs estimated",,,,2003,2003,Public and social welfare,Research,,

Some groups believe that the

a myth. As the commercial kangaroo industry is export oriented, the imposition of import bans by overseas governments would significantly
affect the viability of the industry. Also, agricultural producers who believe they bear the costs of maintaining kangaroo population are
concerned that damage by kangaroos would become unacceptably high if their numbers were to go unchecked.
The aim of this article is to put an economic perspective on the population management of commercially harvested kangaroos. The
major groups in conflict are identified, along with their respective preferences regarding the appropriate level of the kangaroo population.
The underlying reason for conflict, the common property characteristic of kangaroos, is examined, and an economic framework for reconciling
these conflicts through population management presented. The lack of data on kangaroo numbers and the benefits and costs which various
population levels have for the various interest groups remain a major impediment to quantifying an economic model for determining optimal

relevance to current and potential Pest Animal Control CRC research activities, and in consultation with
centre staff. Annual cost values include control and production loss estimates. Many gaps exist in our
knowledge of the major environmental and social impacts vertebrate pests have, therefore these impacts
are discussed for each pest in qualitative terms. However, where quantitative impact information is readily
available it is also included. Major control costs included in the economic impact assessment included baiting, fencing, shooting, and
research associated with the improved management of the specific species. Production losses were
estimated for sheep, cattle and cropping industries as a result of predation on young stock, crop damage
and competition for feed. In addition to these agricultural losses, public sector research and management
costs were included in the economic cost section.
Environmental impacts were typically based on the vertebrate pest’s impact on biodiversity. Where possible,
these impacts have been quantified in cost terms, although it should be noted that accurate information
relating to ecological cause and effect relationships, along with the communities’ valuation of species
preservation are not readily available. Environmental valuations were undertaken for feral cat, fox and carp
impacts, as data was in evidence for these species.
The cost impact of the 11 species subject to assessment totalled $720 million per year. Feral pigs, rabbits,

return and uncertainty. In this paper, we applied a portfolio theory-based decision support tool that helps

determine resource allocation in a way that maximizes expected return and minimizes uncertainty. Our framework

offers three advancements to the literature. First, it helps in making resource allocation decisions across

multiple pests that affect multiple environmental assets. Second, it incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty

in the decision analysis including economic value uncertainty. Finally, it demonstrates a generic approach to design

a choice experiment study to estimate monetary values of a broad group of environmental assets. We find

that a portfolio-based framework applied in conjunction with a choice experiment study can be a useful tool

to guide biosecurity resource allocation decisions. Our results show that disregarding value uncertainty may

cause bias by underestimating true uncertainty in the opportunity set. The choice experiment study revealed substantial

positive non-market values generated by environmental biosecurity in Australia. However, significant

Enabling passive surveillance requires community information campaigns and incentive schemes. This takes funds away from other activities, so it is important to estimate the value of these campaigns relative to other alternatives, such as increasing active (structured) surveillance. This project contributes towards an understanding of the value of passive surveillance provided by members of the community using a case study: the red imported fire ant (RIFA) eradication program in Brisbane. The RIFA program, managed by Biosecurity Queensland Control Centre (BQCC), is well documented. BQCC has an intense public awareness program with multiple activities, including broad and targeted coverage of distinct community groups and zones within the Brisbane area. We have combined data on community engagement events, reports from the public and nest detections recorded by BQCC, with census data to estimate relationships between demographic characteristics of an area and the likelihood that residents from that area will report encounters with RIFA. In this report we present background information and hypotheses regarding the role of community surveillance in the management of biological invasions. This is followed by details of the datasets used and results of a number of analyses. We show the importance of the data clean-up process and identify the limitations that arise when a database designed primarily to track public reports is used for spatio-temporal analyses where accurate dating of events is important. We also estimate the return on investment in community engagement in terms of the savings in structured-search costs it brings. This estimate uses probability maps to calculate the amount of active search that would have been required to detect all the known ant colonies in the period 2006-2010 if passive surveillance would not have been available. Assuming active search costs $400/ha we obtain a value of $52 million return per $1 million invested in community engagement.",EN,,,2007,2010,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Site

Invasive non-native plants have negatively impacted on biodiversity and ecosystem functions world-wide. Because of the large number of species, their wide distributions and varying degrees of impact, we need a more effective method for prioritizing control strategies for cost-effective investment across heterogeneous landscapes.  2. Here, we develop a prioritization framework that synthesizes scientific data, elicits knowledge from experts and stakeholders to identify control strategies, and appraises the cost-effectiveness of strategies. Our objective was to identify the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the total area dominated by high-impact non-native plants in the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB).
3. We use a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin that comprises some of the most distinctive Australian landscapes, including Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. More than 240 non-native plant species are recorded in the Lake Eyre Basin, with many predicted to spread, but there are insufficient resources to control all species.
4. Lake Eyre Basin experts identified 12 strategies to control, contain or eradicate non-native species over the next 50 years. The total cost of the proposed Lake Eyre Basin strategies was estimated at AU$17 billion, an average of AU$34 million annually. Implementation of these strategies is estimated to reduce non-native plant dominance by 17 million ha – there would be a 32% reduction in the likely area dominated by non-native plants within 50 years if these strategies were implemented.
5. The three most cost-effective strategies were controlling Parkinsonia aculeata, Ziziphus mauritiana and Prosopis spp. These three strategies combined were estimated to cost only 001% of total cost of all the strategies, but would provide 20% of the total benefits. Over 50 years, cost-effective spending of AU$23 million could eradicate all non-native plant species from the only threatened ecological community within the Lake Eyre Basin, the Great Artesian Basin discharge springs.
6. Synthesis and applications. Our framework, based on a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, provides a rationale for financially efficient investment in non-native plant management and reveals combinations of strategies that are optimal for different budgets. It also highlights knowledge gaps and incidental findings that could improve effective management of non-native plants, for example addressing the reliability of species distribution data and prevalence of information sharing across states and regions.",EN,,,2015,2065,Mixed,Management_costs,no,Site

Invasive non-native plants have negatively impacted on biodiversity and ecosystem functions world-wide. Because of the large number of species, their wide distributions and varying degrees of impact, we need a more effective method for prioritizing control strategies for cost-effective investment across heterogeneous landscapes.  2. Here, we develop a prioritization framework that synthesizes scientific data, elicits knowledge from experts and stakeholders to identify control strategies, and appraises the cost-effectiveness of strategies. Our objective was to identify the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the total area dominated by high-impact non-native plants in the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB).
3. We use a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin that comprises some of the most distinctive Australian landscapes, including Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. More than 240 non-native plant species are recorded in the Lake Eyre Basin, with many predicted to spread, but there are insufficient resources to control all species.
4. Lake Eyre Basin experts identified 12 strategies to control, contain or eradicate non-native species over the next 50 years. The total cost of the proposed Lake Eyre Basin strategies was estimated at AU$17 billion, an average of AU$34 million annually. Implementation of these strategies is estimated to reduce non-native plant dominance by 17 million ha – there would be a 32% reduction in the likely area dominated by non-native plants within 50 years if these strategies were implemented.
5. The three most cost-effective strategies were controlling Parkinsonia aculeata, Ziziphus mauritiana and Prosopis spp. These three strategies combined were estimated to cost only 001% of total cost of all the strategies, but would provide 20% of the total benefits. Over 50 years, cost-effective spending of AU$23 million could eradicate all non-native plant species from the only threatened ecological community within the Lake Eyre Basin, the Great Artesian Basin discharge springs.
6. Synthesis and applications. Our framework, based on a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, provides a rationale for financially efficient investment in non-native plant management and reveals combinations of strategies that are optimal for different budgets. It also highlights knowledge gaps and incidental findings that could improve effective management of non-native plants, for example addressing the reliability of species distribution data and prevalence of information sharing across states and regions.",EN,,,2015,2065,Mixed,Management_costs,no,Site

The overall aim of this work was to provide detailed information to administrators and managers. The species were:
• Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus);
• Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes);
• The larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus);
• Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus); and
• Triffid weed (Chromolaena odorata).
This report is in two parts. The first is an overview of the case studies, intended to provide an expanded outline of the overall approach and main findings of these studies. Part 1 provides a succinct overview of the approach to economic assessment, and on the case studies, and is intended to be a readable, uncluttered account of the findings. Part 2 consists of appendices that provide the full details of the economic methods used, and the data and findings behind each of the case studies. These appendices are intended for the more technically-oriented reader, and they can serve as a resource for those seeking detailed information. Our studies have highlighted some of the difficulties that face researchers when they attempt to estimate the costs of invasive species and the benefits of control. It is difficult to quantify impacts or to estimate the rates of spread and densification of species invasions. Quantifying the impacts of alien invasions on biodiversity in economic terms is an especially difficult task. It would rather be illuminating to consider the cumulative effects of the steady replacement of a large number of indigenous species by a small number of invasive alien species over time, and not simply take each case study on its own – the latter approach seldom provides an adequate reflection of impacts. However, even with limited data available, and other constraints, it appears (from our and other studies) that control of invasive species will deliver positive benefits, and that control operations, if carried out effectively, will be worth the effort.",EN,,,2006,2006,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Unit

This process is applicable to other weeds and other pastoral degradation or development issues. Using a case study property, three scenarios were developed. Each scenario compared two alternative management options and was analysed using discounted cash flow analysis. Two of the scenarios were based on infested properties and one scenario was based on a currently uninfested property but highly likely to become infested without active containment measures preventing weed seed transport and seedling establishment. The analysis highlighted why particular weedy Sporobolus grass management options may not be financially feasible for the landholder with the infestation. However, at the regional scale, the management options may be highly worthwhile due to a reduction in weed seed movement and new weed invasions.

Enabling passive surveillance requires community information campaigns and incentive schemes. This takes funds away from other activities, so it is important to estimate the value of these campaigns relative to other alternatives, such as increasing active (structured) surveillance. This project contributes towards an understanding of the value of passive surveillance provided by members of the community using a case study: the red imported fire ant (RIFA) eradication program in Brisbane. The RIFA program, managed by Biosecurity Queensland Control Centre (BQCC), is well documented. BQCC has an intense public awareness program with multiple activities, including broad and targeted coverage of distinct community groups and zones within the Brisbane area. We have combined data on community engagement events, reports from the public and nest detections recorded by BQCC, with census data to estimate relationships between demographic characteristics of an area and the likelihood that residents from that area will report encounters with RIFA. In this report we present background information and hypotheses regarding the role of community surveillance in the management of biological invasions. This is followed by details of the datasets used and results of a number of analyses. We show the importance of the data clean-up process and identify the limitations that arise when a database designed primarily to track public reports is used for spatio-temporal analyses where accurate dating of events is important. We also estimate the return on investment in community engagement in terms of the savings in structured-search costs it brings. This estimate uses probability maps to calculate the amount of active search that would have been required to detect all the known ant colonies in the period 2006-2010 if passive surveillance would not have been available. Assuming active search costs $400/ha we obtain a value of $52 million return per $1 million invested in community engagement.",EN,,,2006,2010,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Unit

Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large.",EN,,,2009,2009,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Unit

Invasive non-native plants have negatively impacted on biodiversity and ecosystem functions world-wide. Because of the large number of species, their wide distributions and varying degrees of impact, we need a more effective method for prioritizing control strategies for cost-effective investment across heterogeneous landscapes.  2. Here, we develop a prioritization framework that synthesizes scientific data, elicits knowledge from experts and stakeholders to identify control strategies, and appraises the cost-effectiveness of strategies. Our objective was to identify the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the total area dominated by high-impact non-native plants in the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB).
3. We use a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin that comprises some of the most distinctive Australian landscapes, including Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. More than 240 non-native plant species are recorded in the Lake Eyre Basin, with many predicted to spread, but there are insufficient resources to control all species.
4. Lake Eyre Basin experts identified 12 strategies to control, contain or eradicate non-native species over the next 50 years. The total cost of the proposed Lake Eyre Basin strategies was estimated at AU$17 billion, an average of AU$34 million annually. Implementation of these strategies is estimated to reduce non-native plant dominance by 17 million ha – there would be a 32% reduction in the likely area dominated by non-native plants within 50 years if these strategies were implemented.
5. The three most cost-effective strategies were controlling Parkinsonia aculeata, Ziziphus mauritiana and Prosopis spp. These three strategies combined were estimated to cost only 001% of total cost of all the strategies, but would provide 20% of the total benefits. Over 50 years, cost-effective spending of AU$23 million could eradicate all non-native plant species from the only threatened ecological community within the Lake Eyre Basin, the Great Artesian Basin discharge springs.

Infestations, which range from sparse distributions of scattered runners to dense beds 40 cm thick, covered approximately 8.1 km2 by mid 2004. Various methods for controlling the alga were trialed. The application of coarse sea salt at a concentration of 50 kg/m2 was found to be the most effective method as it rapidly killed the alga, had relatively minor effects on native biota (seagrass and infauna) and was relatively inexpensive. In small-scale trials, frond density of C. taxifolia had decreased by 70–95% one week after salting and no fronds were present after 1 or 6 months. Seagrass and infauna were also affected by salt, but abundances had generally recovered after 6 months. The effectiveness of salting at larger scales depended on the method of application and salting appeared to be most successful in the cooler months when C. taxifolia dies back naturally. Results of large-scale salting trials were mixed. In one waterway, a single application of salt resulted in the apparent removal of almost 5200 m2 of C. taxifolia; in another, repeated salting of a 3000 m2 infestation led to a considerable reduction in the density of the alga, but no overall change in the boundaries of the infestation.

• Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes);
• The larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus);
• Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus); and
• Triffid weed (Chromolaena odorata).
This report is in two parts. The first is an overview of the case studies, intended to provide an expanded outline of the overall approach and main findings of these studies. Part 1 provides a succinct overview of the approach to economic assessment, and on the case studies, and is intended to be a readable, uncluttered account of the findings. Part 2 consists of appendices that provide the full details of the economic methods used, and the data and findings behind each of the case studies. These appendices are intended for the more technically-oriented reader, and they can serve as a resource for those seeking detailed information. Our studies have highlighted some of the difficulties that face researchers when they attempt to estimate the costs of invasive species and the benefits of control. It is difficult to quantify impacts or to estimate the rates of spread and densification of species invasions. Quantifying the impacts of alien invasions on biodiversity in economic terms is an especially difficult task. It would rather be illuminating to consider the cumulative effects of the steady replacement of a large number of indigenous species by a small number of invasive alien species over time, and not simply take each case study on its own – the latter approach seldom provides an adequate reflection of impacts. However, even with limited data available, and other constraints, it appears (from our and other studies) that control of invasive species will deliver positive benefits, and that control operations, if carried out effectively, will be worth the effort.",EN,,,1975,1990,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Site

Key questions commonly remain unanswered including whether invader removal reverses invader impacts and whether management itself has negative ecosystem impacts. We addressed these knowledge gaps using a seven year experimental investigation of Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata. Our case study took advantage of the realities of applied management interventions for Bitou Bush to assess whether it is a driver or passenger of environmental change, and quantified conservation benefits relative to management costs of different treatment regimes. Among treatments examined, spraying with herbicide followed by burning and subsequent re-spraying (spray-fire-spray) proved the most effective for reducing the number of individuals and cover of Bitou Bush. Other treatment regimes (e.g. fire followed by spraying, or two fires in succession) were less effective or even exacerbated Bitou Bush invasion. The spray-fire-spray regime did not increase susceptibility of treated areas to re-invasion by Bitou Bush or other exotic species. This regime significantly reduced plant species richness and cover, but these effects were short-lived. The spray-fire-spray regime was the most cost-effective approach to controlling a highly invasive species and facilitating restoration of native plant species richness to levels characteristic of uninvaded sites. We provide a decision tree to guide management, where recommended actions depend on the outcome of post-treatment monitoring and performance against objectives. Critical to success is avoiding partial treatments and treatment sequences that may exacerbate invasive species impacts. We also show the value of taking advantage of unplanned events, such as wildfires, to achieve management objectives at reduced cost",EN,,,2015,2017,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Site

The overall aim of this work was to provide detailed information to administrators and managers. The species were:
• Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus);
• Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes);
• The larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus);
• Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus); and
• Triffid weed (Chromolaena odorata).
This report is in two parts. The first is an overview of the case studies, intended to provide an expanded outline of the overall approach and main findings of these studies. Part 1 provides a succinct overview of the approach to economic assessment, and on the case studies, and is intended to be a readable, uncluttered account of the findings. Part 2 consists of appendices that provide the full details of the economic methods used, and the data and findings behind each of the case studies. These appendices are intended for the more technically-oriented reader, and they can serve as a resource for those seeking detailed information. Our studies have highlighted some of the difficulties that face researchers when they attempt to estimate the costs of invasive species and the benefits of control. It is difficult to quantify impacts or to estimate the rates of spread and densification of species invasions. Quantifying the impacts of alien invasions on biodiversity in economic terms is an especially difficult task. It would rather be illuminating to consider the cumulative effects of the steady replacement of a large number of indigenous species by a small number of invasive alien species over time, and not simply take each case study on its own – the latter approach seldom provides an adequate reflection of impacts. However, even with limited data available, and other constraints, it appears (from our and other studies) that control of invasive species will deliver positive benefits, and that control operations, if carried out effectively, will be worth the effort.",EN,,,2006,2006,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Site

assets. The allocation of funds for the best return frominvestment requires a careful assessment of expected

return and uncertainty. In this paper, we applied a portfolio theory-based decision support tool that helps

determine resource allocation in a way that maximizes expected return and minimizes uncertainty. Our framework

offers three advancements to the literature. First, it helps in making resource allocation decisions across

multiple pests that affect multiple environmental assets. Second, it incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty

in the decision analysis including economic value uncertainty. Finally, it demonstrates a generic approach to design

a choice experiment study to estimate monetary values of a broad group of environmental assets. We find

that a portfolio-based framework applied in conjunction with a choice experiment study can be a useful tool

to guide biosecurity resource allocation decisions. Our results show that disregarding value uncertainty may

cause bias by underestimating true uncertainty in the opportunity set. The choice experiment study revealed substantial

positive non-market values generated by environmental biosecurity in Australia. However, significant

preference heterogeneity across respondents with regards to different biosecurity outcomes was observed.",EN,,,2014,2014,Mixed,Mixed_costs,no,Unit

Invasive non-native plants have negatively impacted on biodiversity and ecosystem functions world-wide. Because of the large number of species, their wide distributions and varying degrees of impact, we need a more effective method for prioritizing control strategies for cost-effective investment across heterogeneous landscapes.  2. Here, we develop a prioritization framework that synthesizes scientific data, elicits knowledge from experts and stakeholders to identify control strategies, and appraises the cost-effectiveness of strategies. Our objective was to identify the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the total area dominated by high-impact non-native plants in the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB).
3. We use a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin that comprises some of the most distinctive Australian landscapes, including Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. More than 240 non-native plant species are recorded in the Lake Eyre Basin, with many predicted to spread, but there are insufficient resources to control all species.
4. Lake Eyre Basin experts identified 12 strategies to control, contain or eradicate non-native species over the next 50 years. The total cost of the proposed Lake Eyre Basin strategies was estimated at AU$17 billion, an average of AU$34 million annually. Implementation of these strategies is estimated to reduce non-native plant dominance by 17 million ha – there would be a 32% reduction in the likely area dominated by non-native plants within 50 years if these strategies were implemented.
5. The three most cost-effective strategies were controlling Parkinsonia aculeata, Ziziphus mauritiana and Prosopis spp. These three strategies combined were estimated to cost only 001% of total cost of all the strategies, but would provide 20% of the total benefits. Over 50 years, cost-effective spending of AU$23 million could eradicate all non-native plant species from the only threatened ecological community within the Lake Eyre Basin, the Great Artesian Basin discharge springs.
6. Synthesis and applications. Our framework, based on a case study of the ~120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, provides a rationale for financially efficient investment in non-native plant management and reveals combinations of strategies that are optimal for different budgets. It also highlights knowledge gaps and incidental findings that could improve effective management of non-native plants, for example addressing the reliability of species distribution data and prevalence of information sharing across states and regions.",EN,,,2015,2065,Mixed,Management_costs,no,Site

Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large.",EN,,,2005,2009,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Unit

This process is applicable to other weeds and other pastoral degradation or development issues. Using a case study property, three scenarios were developed. Each scenario compared two alternative management options and was analysed using discounted cash flow analysis. Two of the scenarios were based on infested properties and one scenario was based on a currently uninfested property but highly likely to become infested without active containment measures preventing weed seed transport and seedling establishment. The analysis highlighted why particular weedy Sporobolus grass management options may not be financially feasible for the landholder with the infestation. However, at the regional scale, the management options may be highly worthwhile due to a reduction in weed seed movement and new weed invasions.

The results show that intervention in the management of broom in this natural ecosystem is clearly economically justified, and increases in the existing budgets appear to be justified. A combination of control measures, rather than any single measure, is almost always justified. Attempts to eradicate the broom invasion appear to be undesirable, so containment is the preferable strategy. Further, funding bodies should give assurances of future budget levels. The method of analysis reported here should be applicable to other types of biological invasions.",EN,,,2005,2005,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Site

Article  8(h)  of  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  calls  on  member  governments  to  “as  far  as  is  appropriate:  Prevent  the  introduction  of,  control  or  eradicate  those  alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats, or species,” and calls for particular attention to be directed to geographically and evolutionarily isolated ecosystems, including islands. On behalf of  the  CBD  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  the  GlobalInvasive Species Programme (GISP) convened a workshop in October 2002 to review the socio-economic and biological impacts of IAS on island systems.  Experts from 10 countries, as well as GISP,  the  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN),  and  the  World  Conservation  Monitoring  Centre  (WCMC) participated.   Participants in the Experts Consultation reached the following major conclusions: For biological and  socio-economic  reasons,  islands  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  bioinvasions.    IAS  can  influence island environments at all levels of biological organization and also impact agriculture, fisheries,  tourism,  energy,  water,  and  human  health.    Lack  of  access  to  extant  technologies,  particularly in small island developing States (SIDS) has resulted in IAS impacts that might have otherwise been avoided.  While foreign aid can support IAS prevention and control efforts, it canalso facilitate IAS introductions.  Political pressure may exist to introduce IAS that will provide short-term  economic  benefits  regardless  of  the  longer-term  biological  costs.  Although  ballast  water  is  a  well-recognized  pathway  for  marine  bioinvasions,  ship  hull  fouling  by  marineorganisms is an often overlooked but significant pathway.   The  following  actions  were  recommended  by  the  workshop  participants:  Develop  informaticscapacities  to  increase  knowledge  of  and  access  to  successful  and  cost-effective  IAS  prevention  and  management  tools.    Establish  comprehensive  IAS  surveillance  programs  to  enable  earlydetection  and  rapid  response.    Undertake  further  assessments  of  IAS  pathways  and  impacts,  making  the  results  widely  available  to  resource  managers  and  policy  makers.

Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large.",EN,,,2002,2009,Authorities-Stakeholders,Management_costs,no,Unit

contacts with cats. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that cycles between cats and any other warm-blooded
animals. People infected by T. gondii may appear asymptomatic, or have a mild illness, or experience severe, potentially
lethal symptoms; the parasite may also affect behaviour and mental health. T. gondii is also a major contributor to
spontaneous abortion in sheep and goats. Two species of Sarcocystis, another genus of protozoan parasite, cycle through
cats and sheep, causing macroscopic cysts to form in sheep tissues that reduce meat saleability. Toxocara cati, the cat
roundworm, causes minor illnesses in humans and livestock, and the bacterium Bartonella henselae causes cat scratch
disease, an infection that can be contracted by people when scratched or bitten by cats carrying the pathogen.
Aims. We estimated the economic costs of cat-dependent pathogens in Australia.
Methods. We collated national and global data on infection rates, health and production consequences.
Key results. We estimated the costs of two cat-dependent diseases (toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease) in people at AU
$6.06 billion (plausible range AU$2.11–10.7 billion) annually, and the costs to livestock production from toxoplasmosis
and sarcocystosis at AU$11.7 million (plausible range AU$7.67–18.3 million). Most of the human health costs are due to
the associations between T. gondii and higher rates of traffic accidents and mental illness in people. The causality behind
these associations remains uncertain, so those costs may be overestimated. Conversely, our estimates are incomplete,
infections and illness are under-reported or misdiagnosed, and our understanding of disease outcomes is still imperfect, all
of which make our costs underestimated.
Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that substantial benefits to public health and livestock production could be realised
by reducing exposure to cats and breaking parasite transmission cycles.
Implications. Reducing feral cat populations in farming and urban areas, reducing the pet cat population and increasing
rates of pet cat containment could help reduce the burden of cat-dependent diseases to people and livestock.",EN,,,2019,2019,Health,Control,,

contacts with cats. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that cycles between cats and any other warm-blooded
animals. People infected by T. gondii may appear asymptomatic, or have a mild illness, or experience severe, potentially
lethal symptoms; the parasite may also affect behaviour and mental health. T. gondii is also a major contributor to
spontaneous abortion in sheep and goats. Two species of Sarcocystis, another genus of protozoan parasite, cycle through
cats and sheep, causing macroscopic cysts to form in sheep tissues that reduce meat saleability. Toxocara cati, the cat
roundworm, causes minor illnesses in humans and livestock, and the bacterium Bartonella henselae causes cat scratch
disease, an infection that can be contracted by people when scratched or bitten by cats carrying the pathogen.
Aims. We estimated the economic costs of cat-dependent pathogens in Australia.
Methods. We collated national and global data on infection rates, health and production consequences.
Key results. We estimated the costs of two cat-dependent diseases (toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease) in people at AU
$6.06 billion (plausible range AU$2.11–10.7 billion) annually, and the costs to livestock production from toxoplasmosis
and sarcocystosis at AU$11.7 million (plausible range AU$7.67–18.3 million). Most of the human health costs are due to
the associations between T. gondii and higher rates of traffic accidents and mental illness in people. The causality behind
these associations remains uncertain, so those costs may be overestimated. Conversely, our estimates are incomplete,
infections and illness are under-reported or misdiagnosed, and our understanding of disease outcomes is still imperfect, all
of which make our costs underestimated.
Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that substantial benefits to public health and livestock production could be realised
by reducing exposure to cats and breaking parasite transmission cycles.
Implications. Reducing feral cat populations in farming and urban areas, reducing the pet cat population and increasing
rates of pet cat containment could help reduce the burden of cat-dependent diseases to people and livestock.",EN,,,2019,2019,Health,Control,,

Methods. We collated national and global data on infection rates, health and production consequences.
Key results. We estimated the costs of two cat-dependent diseases (toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease) in people at AU
$6.06 billion (plausible range AU$2.11–10.7 billion) annually, and the costs to livestock production from toxoplasmosis
and sarcocystosis at AU$11.7 million (plausible range AU$7.67–18.3 million). Most of the human health costs are due to
the associations between T. gondii and higher rates of traffic accidents and mental illness in people. The causality behind
these associations remains uncertain, so those costs may be overestimated. Conversely, our estimates are incomplete,
infections and illness are under-reported or misdiagnosed, and our understanding of disease outcomes is still imperfect, all
of which make our costs underestimated.
Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that substantial benefits to public health and livestock production could be realised
by reducing exposure to cats and breaking parasite transmission cycles.

to the funding of research. The Commonwealth government

research.",no,Andrew Hoskins,N,,,,"Abstract. The vulnerability of horticultural industries in Australia to the Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera (Dacus)
tryoni under climate change is examined. Vulnerability is defined in terms of sensitivity and adaptation options.
Regional estimates of fruit fly density are fed into an economic model that takes account of costs of damage, management, regulation and research. Sensitivity analyses are used to estimate potential future costs under climate
change by recalculating costs with increases in temperature of 0.5°C, 1.0°C and 2°C. It is assumed that irrigation
will automatically compensate for any changes in rainfall.
The current national, annual cost of Queensland fruit fly is estimated to be $AU28.5 million/year ($25.7–49.9
million), with 60% of the cost borne by commercial growers. Climatic warming threatens the sustainability of area
freedom in the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ) and is likely to increase damage and control costs to commercial
growers in endemic areas, except in northern Australia. Costs to mainland apple, orange, and pear growers are estimated to increase by $3.1, $4.7, and $12.0 million with increases of 0.5°C, 1.0°C, and 2°C, respectively. These represent increases of 25%, 38%, and 95%, respectively, but do not reflect the greatly increased risks of failure to
maintain area freedom in the FFEZ. Growers in endemic Queensland fruit fly areas can expect their costs to increase
42– 82%, compared with 24–83% in the FFEZ. Increased damage to backyard growers is likely, especially in South
Australia and Victoria. Thus the fly poses a real threat to southern States under modest projected increases in temperatures. The extent of the likely cost increases raises questions about the industries’ ability to pay and remain competitive.
The current analysis illustrates the potential benefits of taking a national and strategic approach to the management of insect pests in Australia. A combination of CLIMEX modelling, sensitivity analysis and mapping provided
valuable insights into both industry and regional vulnerabilities. Adaptation options require further quantification,
but that awaits a credible population model of Queensland fruit fly. Costs need to be discounted, depending on the
expected timing of the temperature increases.",EN,,,1991,1994,Agriculture,Control,,

tryoni under climate change is examined. Vulnerability is defined in terms of sensitivity and adaptation options.
Regional estimates of fruit fly density are fed into an economic model that takes account of costs of damage, management, regulation and research. Sensitivity analyses are used to estimate potential future costs under climate
change by recalculating costs with increases in temperature of 0.5°C, 1.0°C and 2°C. It is assumed that irrigation
will automatically compensate for any changes in rainfall.
The current national, annual cost of Queensland fruit fly is estimated to be $AU28.5 million/year ($25.7–49.9
million), with 60% of the cost borne by commercial growers. Climatic warming threatens the sustainability of area
freedom in the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ) and is likely to increase damage and control costs to commercial
growers in endemic areas, except in northern Australia. Costs to mainland apple, orange, and pear growers are estimated to increase by $3.1, $4.7, and $12.0 million with increases of 0.5°C, 1.0°C, and 2°C, respectively. These represent increases of 25%, 38%, and 95%, respectively, but do not reflect the greatly increased risks of failure to
maintain area freedom in the FFEZ. Growers in endemic Queensland fruit fly areas can expect their costs to increase
42– 82%, compared with 24–83% in the FFEZ. Increased damage to backyard growers is likely, especially in South
Australia and Victoria. Thus the fly poses a real threat to southern States under modest projected increases in temperatures. The extent of the likely cost increases raises questions about the industries’ ability to pay and remain competitive.
The current analysis illustrates the potential benefits of taking a national and strategic approach to the management of insect pests in Australia. A combination of CLIMEX modelling, sensitivity analysis and mapping provided
valuable insights into both industry and regional vulnerabilities. Adaptation options require further quantification,
but that awaits a credible population model of Queensland fruit fly. Costs need to be discounted, depending on the

The national stocktake of biosecurity investment uses the national portfolio investment
optimisation model’s six ICs to provide a structured assessment of how all Australian
governments are investing in biosecurity.
Reported through the NBC, the annual stocktake captures estimates of jurisdictions’ overall
investment in biosecurity with results available for total state and territory investment and
total Australian Government investment. The stocktake has been completed for the 2013–14,
2014–15 and 2015–16 financial years.
Unfortunately, the three stocktakes are still considered confidential by governments and,
as a result, are not public. The panel was provided with copies but with restrictions on
what information can be reported publicly. The panel believes that greater transparency by
jurisdictions and the NBC on biosecurity investments would facilitate the required debate in
this critical area.
High-level summary results of the investment stocktakes are consistent with the anecdotal
claims made in submissions to this review that proportionally government appropriation
funding has been static or in decline while externally sourced funds (that is, cost recovery and
levies) have been increasing (Figure 10). While there is no doubt there has been some change

Surveys of Volunteers in the Greater

During 1996, Lynn Rees from Lane Cove National
Park', undertook a survey of the 45 councils and
related land management agencies in the Greater
Sydney Region with respect to bush management
in areas within their responsibility. Of these, 30
had some sort of volunteer program. The total
number of registered volunteers was 4730, in a
total of 375 groups. They contributed about
80,000 hours of time in 1994-95, which, at
commercial bush management company rates,
equates to over $2 million contribution to
environmental weeds control in the Greater
Sydney Region (Rees, pers. comm.). At standard
Landcare volunteer contribution rates this would
